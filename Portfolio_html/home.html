  <h1 class="title">"Lessons from a Self-Taught Software Engineer"</h1>

  <h2 class="self">I am a self-taught software engineer who is passionate about using my skills to create a better life
    for myself and my family.
    I have three children and a supportive wife, and we currently reside in Conyers, Georgia.
    <h2 class="self">
      I was raised in Birmingham, Alabama and attended Miles College in Fairfield with a major in Criminal Justice.
    </h2>
    <h2 class="self">
      I also became a member of Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity Spring 2005. Throughout my life, I have faced challenges and
      overcome them through determination and hard work.
      That same grit will lead to my future success as a Software Engineer. I am excited to continue growing and
      education in the field.
