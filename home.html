<h1>"Lessons from a Self-Taught Software Engineer"</h1>
<h2>I am a self-taught software engineer who is passionate about using my skills to create a better life for myself and my family.
  I have three children and a supportive wife, and we currently reside in Conyers, Georgia.
  I was raised in Birmingham, Alabama and attended Miles College in Fairfield with a major in Criminal Justice.
  I also became a member of Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity Spring 2005. Throughout my life, I have faced challenges and overcome them through determination and hard work.
  That same grit will lead to my future success as a Software Engineer. I am excited to continue growing and education in the field.
